# HashMap-TreeMap-Assignment
Made for Comp 2503


Reflection
- This assignment as a whole was a success with few hiccups due to it being another iteration of previous assignments only with HashMaps and TreeMaps rather than the before array, binary search tree, and linked lists.
- Starting the assignment was the hardest part as there was less information given than previous assignments.
